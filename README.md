# Equipe 3 - Uno



## Module needed to play the game. 

This game is using the module pygame, so you will have to be sure to have it installed on your computer, if it isn't installed use the command <pip install pygame>.
(If you have an error about a missing module, please install it. Normally, all the other needed are already installed with anaconda but if you modified it for some reason maybe you don't have them anymore)

Once you get it, you will be able to enjoy our game !

## Getting started with the client

This game is played in a Jupyter Notebook. To launch it, open uno_client.ipyn in Jupyter Notebook and select "Cell" -> "Run all".

By default, the server configured is "localhost" with port "8080". These settings must be changed to match the information of the server you're playing on (the location where to make the changes is indicated in the notebook).

## Getting started with the server

If you want to host your own ICHI server, open the file uno_srv.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and select "Cell" -> "Run all". By default, the port used by the server is 8080, but you can change this in the notebook (the location where the change is to be made is indicated).
