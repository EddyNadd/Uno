## Getting started with the client

This game is played in a Jupyter Notebook. To launch it, open uno_client.ipyn in Jupyter Notebook and select "Cell" -> "Run all".

By default, the server configured is "localhost" with port "8080". These settings must be changed to match the information of the server you're playing on (the location where to make the changes is indicated in the notebook).
